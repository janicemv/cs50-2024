# BOOK OF DREAMS
#### Video Demo:  [CLICK HERE](https://youtube.com/live/3ek7k4NLrQs)
#### Description:

This is an app to register a person's dreams. They can add multiple categories to each dream, as well as select if it was a lucid dream or not. The dreams are presented like blog posts on the front page, the categories can be seen, altered and added in a specific page.

I used a lot of my knowledge from weeks 8 and 9 to develop this app. I have many ideas to create, and I decided to go with something that would be ready faster. I know I still have many things to learn and I want to learn them all! Right now I am close to starting a new programming course, so my deadline was a bit short.

After creating the basic features of my app, I saw that Flask has a Blueprint for blogs that would work perfectly for this. Lesson learned: check documentation **before** starting! :D 


## Pages

* **My Dreams -** This page shows every register on your Book, the most recent on top.
* **New Dream -** Allows you to register a new dream and select its category and whether it was a lucid dream or not. *Future features include adding tags to your dreams, such as names of people who were present and other relevant themes that may co-occur and repeat.*
* **Categories -** Allows you to add and see the categories of your dreams. *Future features include editing and deleting categories.*

## Layout

**Bootstrap**

I used Bootstrap to:

- Make a responsive website
- Create a nice-looking, responsive menu
- Manage the containers and spaces for the contents of my pages
- Create a good-looking footer
- Add styles to my buttons and set their positions

### Design choices

**- Logo:** <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/dreamcatcher" title="dreamcatcher icons">Dreamcatcher icons created by Flat Icons - Flaticon</a>
**- Color pallete:** Created on <a href="https://color.adobe.com/Exploring-this-great-world-.-Mixed-media-color-theme-5721c17e-73ed-40f5-ba0f-03cb9c54369e">Adobe Color</a>
**- Fonts:** <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>

## Future Ideas
